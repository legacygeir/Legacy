Intro: 	G Gmaj7  C   

	Am    D  G

G               Gmaj7     
City girls just seem 
            C 
to find out early, 
Am               
how to open doors 
             D
with just a smile.
   G                    
A rich old man and 
 Gmaj7             C
she won't have to worry; 
        Am         
she'll dress up all 
     C              G
in lace and go in style.

G               Gmaj7
Late at night a big 
                 C
old house gets lonely; 
        Am           
I guess every form of 
                D
refuge has its price.
       G                
And it breaks her heart 
    Gmaj7             C   
to think her love is only 
      Am           
Given to a man with 
 C                G   C  D
hands as cold as ice.


       G                           
So she tells him she must 
 Gmaj7          C
go out for the evening 
   Am                   
To comfort an old friend 
               D
who's feeling down.
    G                    
But he knows where 
       Gmaj7          C
she's goin' as she's leavin'; 
      Am             
She's headed for that 
 C                G
cheatin' side of town.

          G   C            
You can't hide 
            G
your lyin' eyes, 
         Em   Hm
and your smile   
              Am   D
is a thin disguise.
             G  G9  
I thought by now 
          C  A  
you'd realize 
      Am              
there ain't no way to 
D                 G Gmaj7
hide those lying eyes.

  C Am D G

        G                     
 On the other side 
   Gmaj7         C
of town a boy is waiting 
     Am            
with fiery eyes and 
                     D
dreams no-one could steal
     G                       
 She drives on throught 
     Gmaj7       C 
the night anticipating 
       Am            
Cos he makes him feel 
     C               G  C  D
the way she used to feel


     G             Gmaj7     
 She rushes to his arms 
            C
they fall together 
     Am              
She whispers that its 
             D
only for a while
    G                      
She swears that soon 
           Gmaj7          C
she'll be coming back forever 
    Am             
She pulls away and 
C                 G
leaves him with a smile

          G   C            
You can't hide 
            G
your lyin' eyes, 
         Em   Hm
and your smile   
              Am   D
is a thin disguise.
             G  G9  
I thought by now 
          C  A  
you'd realize 
      Am              
there ain't no way to 
D                 G Gmaj7
hide those lying eyes..

  C Am D G

G               Gmaj7            
She gets up and pours 
           C
herself a strong one 
    Am           
And stares out at 
                     D
the stars up in the sky.
  G                     
Another night, 
      Gmaj7      C 
it's gonna be a long one; 
    Am              
She draws the shade 
     C                 G  C  D
and hangs her head to cry.


        G                   
And she wonders how 
    Gmaj7         C
it ever got this crazy 
    Am                
She thinks about a boy 
             D
she knew in school
     G               
 Did she get tired 
    Gmaj7            C 
or did she just get lazy 
      Am          
She's so far gone, 
     C                 G
she feels just like a fool

G              Gmaj7                  
My, oh my, you sure know 
       C  
how to arrange things; 
    Am                
You set it up so well,
          D
 so carefully.
         G                           
Ain't it funny how your 
 Gmaj7           C
new life didn't change things; 
       Am               
You're still the same 
     C               G
old girl you used to be.

          G   C            
You can't hide 
            G
your lyin' eyes, 
         Em   Hm
and your smile   
              Am   D
is a thin disguise.
             G  G9  
I thought by now 
          C  A  
you'd realize 
      Am              
there ain't no way to 
D                 G Gmaj7 
hide those lying eyes..
 
C Am 

      Am              
there ain't no way to 
D                 G Gmaj7  
hide those lying eyes..    
 Am            
Honey you can’t 
  D                G Gmaj7  
hide your lyin’ eyes

C Am D G
