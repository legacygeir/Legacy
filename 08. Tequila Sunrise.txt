It's another tequila sunrise 
D          		   Am  
 Starin' slowly 'cross the sky,   
D7              G
they said goodbye

G
He was just a hired hand 
D                    	    
Workin' on the dreams 
               Am D7
he planned to try, 
            G
the days go by


Em                   C
Ev'ry night when the sun goes down 
Em           C              Em
Just another lonely boy in town 
    Am                   D7
And she's out runnin' 'round 

G
She wasn't just another woman 
D                               Am 
And I couldn't keep from comin' on  
D7             G
  It's been so long

G                                        
Oh, and it's a hollow feelin' 
D                             Am   
when It comes down to bein' friends 
D7        G
 It never ends 

Guitarsolo:   G    D    Am    D7    G

Am           D
Take another shot of courage 
Hm              E               Am  H7
Wonder why the right ones never come  
             Em7  A
You just get numb

G                              
It's another tequila sunrise,
 D                     
   this old world still 
             Am  D7  
   looks the same,
          G
Another frame,...
