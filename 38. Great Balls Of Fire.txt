Great Balls Of Fire - Jerry Lee Lewis


C
   You shake my nerves 

and you rattle my brain
F7
   Too much love 

drives a man insane
G7                  
   You broke my will,  
 F7
but what a thrill
C
Goodness gracious 

great balls of fire

C
I laughed at love cause 

I thought it was funny
F7
You came along and 

you moved me honey
G7                
I changed my mind, 
            F7
love's just fine
C!
Goodness gracious
