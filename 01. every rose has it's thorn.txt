Intro: G, Cadd9   G, Cadd9

 G                             
    We both lie silently still, 
       Cadd9
in the dead of the night.
              G               
 Although we both lie close together, 
         Cadd9
we feel miles apart inside.
         G    
 Was it something I said, 
    Cadd9
or something I did, 
 	G                 Cadd9
did my words not come out right?
          D              
Though I tried not to hurt you, 
Dsus4       C
though I tried, 

but I guess that's why they say

G                      Cadd9 
   Every rose has its thorn.
           G                  Cadd9
Just like every night has its dawn.
           G     D            Cadd9
Just like every cowboy sings a sad,
         G                         Cadd9
    sad song.  Every rose has its thorn.

   G                          
I listen to our favorite song, 
                Cadd9
playing on the radio.
         G
Hear the DJ say 

loves a game of easy 
               Cadd9
come and     easy go.
        G         Cadd9 
But I wonder, does he know?
        G             Cadd9
Has he ever felt like this?  
       D  
And I know that 

you'd be here right now 
     C
if I   coulda let you know somehow, I guess

G                      Cadd9 
   Every rose has its thorn.
           G                  Cadd9
Just like every night has its dawn.
           G     D            Cadd9
Just like every cowboy sings a sad,
         G                         Cadd9
    sad song.  Every rose has its thorn.


Em                    D         
  Though it's been a while now, 
       Cadd9              G 
I can still feel so much pain.
Em                   D                                              
  Like a knife that cuts you 
 
the wound heals,    
 C		                G
   but the scar, that scar remains

Solo: G-Cadd9  G  Cadd9

G  Cadd9   G Cadd9

G  
  I know I could’ave saved 

our love that night if I'd     
Cadd9
  known what to say.
G
  Instead of making love    
         Cadd9
we both  made our separate ways.
           G       
 And now I hear 
                 Cadd9 
you've found somebody new, 
      G
and that I never meant 
     Cadd9
that much to you.
      D
To hear that tears me up inside, 
        C
and to see you cuts me 

like a knife, I guess

G                      Cadd9 
   Every rose has its thorn.
           G                  Cadd9
Just like every night has its dawn.
           G     D            Cadd9
Just like every cowboy sings a sad,
         G                         Cadd9
    sad song.  Every rose has its thorn.
