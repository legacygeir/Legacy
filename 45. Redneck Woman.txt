I've got posters on my wall 

of Skynard, Kid and Strait,
      B7
Some people look down on me, 

But I don't give a rip,
    A			
I stand bare-footed in my own 
		     A!
front yard, With a baby on my hip,

              E

I ain't no high class broad, 

I'm just a product of my rasin,

I say hey yall and hee haw, 
       A

on my front porch all year long,
    E

to every Charlie Daniels songs 
    B7

Oh but I can buy the same damn thing,
      E       F#5         G5                      
On a Walmart shelf half price, 
      G#5       A
And still look sexy, just as sexy, 

as those models on T.V.
      E
No I don't need no designer tag, 

To make my man want me,
B7
You might think I'm trashy,  

A little too hard core,
    A
But in my neck of the woods, 

I'm just the girl next door,

             E
