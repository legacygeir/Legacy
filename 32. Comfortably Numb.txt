Comfortably Numb – Pink Floyd
 ----------- ----

Intro: Hm


 Hm			 A	        
 Hello, Is there anybody in there? 
	                G
Just nod if you can hear me.
   Em   	       Hm
     Is there anyone at home ?

 Hm                      
 Come on now. 
             A
I hear your feeling down. 
 G                Em 
I can ease your pain 
             Hm
And get you on your feet again


 Hm                             
 Relax, I'll need 
          A
some information first.
 G               Em 
 Just the basic facts, 
         Hm
can you show me where it hurts?

 D                            A      
   There is no pain you are receding.
 D                                A
   A distant ship smoke on the horizon
C                                G     
  You are only coming through in waves.
      C        
 Your lips move, 
                             G
but I can't hear what you're saying
      D                     A     
 When I was a child I had a fever.
     D                           A
  My hands felt just like two ballons
C                               G     
  Now I've got that feeling once again 
                                C
I can't explain, you would not understand
                   G  
 This is not how I am 
 A   Bm  C(9)     G                   D
   I         have become comfortably numb.

 Guitarsolo:  A  D  A  C  G  C  G   A  
                                        
 D            G                  D
I      have become comfortably numb.


 Hm                 A               
 O.K. Just a little pinprick 
                     G
There'll be no more aaaaaaaah!
  Em             Hm
    But you may feel a little sick
         Hm                   
 Can you stand up? 
                   A
I do believe it's working, good 
                  G                 Em
That'll keep you going through the show
      Hm
 Come on it's time to go.

D                           A      
 There is no pain you are receding.
 D                               A
   A distant ship smoke on the horizon
C                                G     
  You are only coming through in waves. 
      C           
Your lips move but 
                           G
I can't hear what you're saying

      D                           
 When I was a child,
             A
 I caught a fleeting glimpse
 D                         A
   Out of the corner of my eye
C                     
  I turned to look 
            G
but it was gone 
                       C
I cannot put my finger on it now  

The child is grown
     G            
 The dream is gone 
   Asus  C(9) 
And I  
             G                D
     have become comfortably numb.
