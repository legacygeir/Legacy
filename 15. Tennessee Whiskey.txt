A                         
I used to spend my nights 
             Bm
out in a barroom
                                 
Liquor was the only love 
      A  D/A  A  
I’d known
  A                      
But you rescued me from 
                   Bm
reachin’ for the bottom
                                  
And brought me back 
                A  D/A  A
from being too far gone
 
 

 
A             D/A   A 
You’re as smooth      
                Bm
as Tennessee whiskey
                      
You’re as sweet 
              A  D/A  A
as strawberry wine
                  
You’re as warm as 
             Bm
a glass of brandy
                          
And honey, I stay stoned 
                      A  D/A  A
on your love all the time
 
 
Guitar: Intro riff
 
A                    
I’ve looked for love 
                     Bm
in all the same old places
                 
Found the bottom 
                   A  D/A  A
of a bottle always dry
                                 
But when you poured out your heart 
          Bm
I didn’t waste it
                                    
‘Cause there’s nothing like your love 
           A  D/A   A
to get me high
 
 
 
A             D/A   A 
You’re as smooth      
                Bm
as Tennessee whiskey
                      
You’re as sweet 
              A  D/A  A
as strawberry wine
                  
You’re as warm as 
             Bm
a glass of brandy
                          
And honey, I stay stoned 
                      A  D/A  A
on your love all the time
