As good as I once was

Intro

Bb C F Fsus F

    
She said, 
 
"I've seen you in 
 Bb
here before."
C     
  I said, 

"I've been here
   F
a time or two."
  
She said, "Hello, 
             Bb     
my name is Bobby Jo.
C             
  Meet my twin 
        F        F7
sister Betty Lou.
                      
And we're both feeling 
       Bb 
kinda wild tonight.
C                 
  You're the only 
        F
cowboy in this place.
             
And if you're 
           G
up for a rodeo.
              
I'll put a big 
       C7 
Texas smile on your 
 Bb7 B7   C7
face."



I said, "Girls,"

               
I ain't as good 
       Bb      
as I once was
C            
  I got a few 
  F
years on me now
                 Bb  
But there was a time 
             C
back in my prime
             
When I could 
        F         F7
really lay it down
                
And if you need 
      Bb         
some love tonight
C                   
  Then I might have 
F     C/E Dm
just enough
                
I ain't as good 
     Gm
as I once was
               
But I'm 
    C
as good once 
      Bb     Am Gm F
as I ever was



Interlude:

Bb C F Fsus F

 
  
I still 

hang out with my 
Bb              
best friend Dave
C 
  I've known him 

since we were 
 F
kids at school
            
Last night 
              Bb
he had a few shots
                 C  
Got in a tight spot 

hustlin' a 
 F	     F7
game of pool
                  
With a couple 
    Bb         
of redneck boys
C              
  One great big, 
      F
bad biker man
                  
I heard David yell 
   G
across the room
            
"Hey buddy, 

how 'bout 
   C7
a helping hand."

Bb7 B7   C7

          C
I said, "Dave,"


I ain't as good 
       Bb      
as I once was
          
My how the 
  F
years have flown
                 Bb 
But there was a time 
             C
back in my prime
                   
When I could really 
  F
hold my own
                           
But if you wanna 
  Bb
fight tonight
C                             
  Guess those boys 

don't look 
F    C/E Dm
all that tough

I ain't as good 
     Gm
as I once was
               
But I'm 
    C
as good once 
      Bb     Am Gm F
as I ever was


              D#            
I used to be hell 

on wheels
Bb/D              
  Back when I was 
    F
a younger man
                   
Now my body says, 
 G7
"You can't do this, boy."
                   
But my pride says, 
      C7      
"Oh, yes you 

Bb7 B7   C7
can."



I ain't as good 
       Bb      
as I once was
C               
 That's just the 
  F
cold, hard truth
  
I still throw 
       Bb
a few back, 
                C
talk a little smack
                
When I'm feelin' 
   F         F7
bullet proof
                     
So 

don't double dog 
Bb         
dare me now
C                 
  'Cause I'd have 
     F   C/E  Dm
to call your bluff
               
I ain't as good 
      Gm
as I once was
                  
But 
        C
I'm as good once 
     Bb  Am Gm 
as I ever was
F               
 May not be good 
       Bb
as I once was
               
But 
        C
I'm as good once 
     Bb   Am Gm F
as I ever was
