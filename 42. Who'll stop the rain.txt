Long as I remember 
     A 
the rain been 
        E
comin' down
E 
Clouds of 

mystery pourin' 
    A
confusion 
         E
on the ground
A 
Good men through 
     E
the ages 
  A
Tryin' 
             E
to find the sun
A 
And I wonder 
  B
still I wonder 
 C#m             E
Who'll stop the rain


E
I went down Virginia 
         A
seeking shelter 
          E
from the storm
E
Caught up 
        G#m
in the fable 
   A
I watched 
           E
the tower grow


A 
Five-year plans 
     E
and new deals 
  A 
Wrapped in 
         E
golden chains
A 
And I wonder 
  B
still I wonder 
 C#m             E
Who'll stop the rain

E
Heard the singers playin', 
 A                  E
how we cheered for more
      E
The crowd had 
         G#m
rushed together, 
      A             E
just tryin to keep warm
A 
Still the rain 
      E
kept pourin' 
 A            E
Fallin on my ears
A 
And I wonder 
  B
still I wonder 
 C#m !
