Ooh, well, I got a girl with 

a record machine, 

when it comes to rockin', she's a queen.
 D7				    A!    
Went to a dance on a saturday night.   
n.c.
  all alone where I could 
  
  hold her tight.
     E				      A! 
She lives on the twentieth floor uptown.
n.c.
  The elevator's broken down.

So I walk one, two flight,

three flight four, 

five, six, seven flight, 

eight flight more.

  Up on the twelfth

A
fifteen before I'm ready to drag.

                  A
I'm too tired to rock.

Well she called me up on the telephone, 

said, "Come on over, 

baby, I'm all alone."
          D7			    A!  
I said,      "Baby, you're mighty sweet,
n.c.
   but I'm in bed with a aching feet."
E7				A!    
This went on for a couple of days, 
n.c.
  but I couldn't stay away.
