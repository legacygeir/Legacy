Wastin’ time with you – Carlene Carter					
H – dur


Intro:  H


     H                                               
Get out of bed 
      A
you sleepy head 
      E      H7    E
And shake a leg or two
     E                                                                
The sun is up, 
            A
pour some coffee in the cup  
     E      H7        E  E7 
The rent is way past due 
          A                 					      
Could I rewind 
     E
the hands of time 
                   H7
Back to my wasted youth
     E                                               
I'd lay the days 
     A
all out in a line 
      E       H7        E
And waste my time with you 

       E                                                    
The freeway's like 
   A
a parkin' lot.  
          E      H7     E
And I'm runnin' low on time
     E                                             
I'm workin' double 
  A
shifts to find 
     E        H7    E E7
I'm barely scrapin' by 
     A                                                                         
What I would give 
   E
if I could live 
     E                 H7
The way the rich folks do 
        E                                             
Just kickin' back 
       A
in my Cadillac 
     E       H7        E
And wastin' time with you 


Guitar/Piano:  

E  A  E	A  E  H7  E


          A					  
We could take the time 

so hard to find 
      E
And wrestle it to the floor 
      A                                                                      
Then wake up 

and do nothin' like 
                      H7   
it's never been done before 

     E                                                    
Sometimes at night 
      A
my thoughts ignite 
     E         H7    E
In dreams of great escape
    E                                          
A couple sticks 
     A
of dynamite 
    E        H7      E  E7 
And no more workin' late 
      A                                                                                     
I'm sure the cops 
      E
would understand  
                        H7
They're workin' people too
         E                                                          
And I'd like to take 
       A
this chance to thank 
       E            H7       E 
Those hard workin' boys in blue 
        E                                            
Just kickin' back 
        A
in our Cadillac 
     E       H7        E
And wastin' time with you 
         E    H7       E                          			
Just wastin' time with you.  
            E
I wanna be waaaastin'              
H7             E E6
tiiiiime with you
