    E                   H           
The pale white-collared gentlemen 
        A              E
They're coming side by side.
    A             G#m          
The holy court of justice 
     F#m            H
To a meeting in the night
     E                               
They do not talk, 
     H 
they do not smile 
     A                E
They think and that's enough
     A                   G#m               
They will not make their judgment 
          F#m            H
'Till the moon rises off above
         E                H       
And of a thousand soldier boys 
   E                    H
At last they made their choice
    E          A               
Another victim soon arrives 
   H             E
at graveyard paradise

F#m H     E
 
    E                 H            
And there's a smiling little girl 
       A             E
whose dinner was a snail
     A               G#m         
It's hard for her to walk 
              F#m          H 
She's got her brother in a rail
    E              H              
Her father's lying in the mud 
    A                 E
Her mother's murdered too
    A                 G#m              
Her bloody eyes can't even see 
        F#m                H 
And she don't know what to do
        E                   H          
But the pale-white collared guys 
      E            H 
Those desperate vampires
        E                                   
They're watching her 
     A
with blood shut eyes 
     H             E
from graveyard paradise
 
A   G#m   F#m   E      
A   G#m   F#m   
F#m H     E
 
E             H                 
Everything is black and cold 
   A             E
In graveyard paradise
    A               G#m                
And when somebody's talking there 
      F#m              H 
Is it just to tell you lies
      E                   H        
Those pale-white collared gentlemen 
          A                E
Oh yes, I saw them as they stood
A                       G#m               
Outside the graveyard's gate 
              F#m              H 
They would be laughing if they could
    E             H        
And when somebody dies 
     E                H 
When moon rise in the sky
        E                            
They're watching you 
     A 
with blood shut eyes 
     H             E
From graveyard paradise
