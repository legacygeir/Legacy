  When I was a little itty bitty baby 
		C		G
my momma would rock me in the cradle.
                                D7
In them old, cotton fields back home.
       G
It was down in Louisiana, 
C			    G
just about a mile from Texarkana.
        D7                      G   G7
In them old, cotton fields back home
 
              C
Oh, when them cotton balls get rotten, 
	  G
you can't pick very much cotton.
