The old folks say that you 
D7                    A7
gotta end your day by ten 
          D7            
if you're out on a date 
                                   A7
and you bring it home late, it's a sin 
         E7                                                     
There's just ain’t no excuse 
         D7
and you know you're gonna lose, 
           A7 
you never win, I'll say it again 


                            
 And it's all because 
     A7              
Your Mama don't dance 
           D7                A7
and your Daddy don't rock n'roll 
     D7                
Your Mama don't dance 
                             A7

    D7!                    
you pull into a drive-way , 
      D7     		
you  find a place to park,  
    D7
you hop into the back seat
          D7                                               
where you know it's nice and dark. 
        D7                  
You're just about to groove, 
          D7
and you think it's a breeze, when
          D7               
there's a light in your eye 
             D7           E7
and another guy says, Louise, 
                   D7 
you're comin' with me, 
                      A 
and we’ll call the police!



And it's all because

          D7                 A7
and your Daddy don't rock n'roll 
     D7               
Your Mama don't dance 
                             A7
