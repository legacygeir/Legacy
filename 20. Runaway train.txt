Runaway train - SOUL ASYLUM

Intro: C

C				        		          
  Call you up in 

the middle of the night. 
Em/B
  Like a firefly 

without a light.   
Am 				          				           
  You were there 

like a blowtorch burning  
                      
I was a key that could 
 G
use a little turning 
  
C				      
 So tired that 

I couldn't even sleep.   
Em/B
 So many secrets 

I couldn't keep
Am			              	
 Promised myself 

I wouldn't weep. 
                  
One more promise 
    G
I couldn't keep
F			    
It seems no one 
      G	
can help me now 
    C   	
I'm in too deep 
        Am
There's no way out
F                Em    
This time I have really 
        G
led myself astray


C			        
 Runaway train 

never going back. 
Em/B
 Wrong way on 

a one way track
Am				          
 Seems like I should 

be getting somewhere. 
G 			
 Somehow I'm neither 
       hold G!  bass
here nor there.


C				       
 Can you help me 

remember how to smile.  
Em/B
 Make it somehow 

all seem worthwhile
Am			          
 How on earth did 

I get so jaded?  
G
 Life's mystery 

seems so faded

C				   
 I can go where 

no one else can go  
Em/B
 I know what 

no one else knows
Am			             
 Here I am just 

drownin' in the rain  
G
 With a ticket for 

a runaway train
    F               	        	     
And everything seems 
 G
cut and dry 
 C           
Day and night 
  Am
earth and sky 
F          Em  
Somehow I  just 
           G
don’t believe it

C
 Runaway train 

never going back. 
Em/B
 Wrong way on 

a one way track
Am
 Seems like I should 

be getting somewhere. 
G 			
 Somehow I'm neither 
              C
here nor there.

C   Am   F   Em  G

C! ( Stortromma går! )		      
  Bought a ticket for 

a runaway train   
Em/B!
 Like a madman 

laughing at the rain.
Am!			               
 A little out of touch 

a little insane   
G!
 It’s just easier 

than dealing with the pain


C
 Runaway train 

never going back. 
Em/B
 Wrong way on 

a one way track
Am
 Seems like I should 

be getting somewhere.

 Somehow I'm neither 
              C
here nor there.

 Runaway train 

never coming back   
Em/B
 Runaway train 

tearing up the track
Am				  
 Runaway train 

burning in my veins

 Runaway but it 

always seems the same.
