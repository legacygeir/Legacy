Ain't Good Enough For You  - Bruce Springsteen

Intro: E!  A   C#m  D  E
                 A				
 Well you don't like,

don't like the way I walk 
	       C#m
And you don't like,

don't like the way I talk
         D			
You criticize 

about me endlessly 
	E
Logic defies 

how you get stuck with me


            A                            
And you complain 

about the clothes I wear 
  	  C#m
And you explain 

there's other boys out there
        D				
You complain 

my car makes too much noise 
	 E
And you cry 

I'm always out with the boys

    F#m                         
Whoa whoa (

whoa whoa whoa whoa) 
                 A
I give up little darling 

(whoa whoa little darling)
               D 	                      
Yeah no matter what I do, 
	 E   
girl you know it's true 
           F#m             E!
Ain't good enough for you


    A					
You complain 

the way I love you at night 
    C#m
You explain 

I'm really not your type
         D				
If we go out, 

you say I'm such a bore 
           E
If we stay in, 

you say what are we living for
              A					
I don't understand, 

there's nothing I can do 
	       C#m
There ain't no way 

I can satisfy you
           D				
End of the night 

I lean in for a kiss 
	       E
Here comes the pitch, 

a swing and a miss

     F#m                        
Whoa whoa 

(whoa whoa whoa whoa) 
                 A
I quit a little darling 

(whoa whoa little darling)
               D 	   
Yeah no matter what I do, 
	   E    
girl you know it's true 
            F#m           E 
Ain't good enough for you

Piano som vers:	A   C#m   D   E    
		A   C#m   D   E  

     F#m                       
Whoa whoa (

whoa whoa whoa whoa) 
                  A
hey hey a little darling (

whoa whoa little darling)
               D 	              
Yeah no matter what I do, 
	 E    
girl you know it's true 
              F#m        E
Ain't good enough for you

	    A				
I tried to change, 

I got a job in sales 
	   C#m
I bought a shirt 

uptown in Bloomindales
	     D		
And babe I tried 

to make the leatest scene 
	E
Hitting cool 

just like Jimmy Iovine
           A					        
I bought a record 

with all the latest grooves 
  	  C#m
A book of love 

with all the latest moves
              D                                        	 
I bought some flowers 

and I waited at your door 
             E		
And you came out, 

didn't want to see me no more

     F#m                                                           
Whoa whoa (

whoa whoa whoa whoa) 
        	  A
I quit a little darling 

(whoa whoa little darling)
               D 		                                           
Yeah no matter what I do, 
    	 E 
girl you know it's true 

            F#m 
Ain't good enough for you 

Hey! Hey! Hey!
	  D                                      
No matter what I do, 
         E    
girl you know it's true 
  	   F#m
Ain't good enough for you   Aww
          D                                                            
no matter what I do, 
         E
girl you know it's true  
           F#m 		 E ( 4 takter – bassnedgang )
Ain't good enough for you.   Whoaaa!
