G                                  		 
   It seems like yesterday    
Hm
   But it was long ago   
C               
  Janey was lovely, 
             G
she was the queen of my nights
D             		                                         
  There in the dark-ness 
           C
with the radio playin' low   
G
  And the secrets that we shared
Hm			          
  The mountains that we moved 
C                       
  Caught like a wildfire 
 G
out of control
                 C                                                          
Till there was nothin' 

left to burn and 
	         D    | D |
nothing left to prove

        Em       D  		
And I remember what 
            G
she said to me.   
         Em  
How she swore 
         C             G
that it never would end
Em               D  	
  I remember how she 
         C
held me oh so tight   
C             
Wish I didn't know now 
         D
what I didn't know then


G              Hm   
   Against the wind        
C                  
   We were runnin' 
              G
against the wind
         C          Hm       
We were young and strong, 
          Am      
but just runnin' 
 C           G
against the wind

| G | G | G |

G                                 
  And the years rolled slowly past
Hm
  I found myself alone
C                       
 Surrounded by strangers 
      G
I thought were my friends
D                        
 found myself further and 
    C
further from my home and I
G                      
  Guess I lost my way 
Hm
  There were oh so many roads  
        C          
I was living to run 
      G
and runnin' to live
       C                  
Never worried about paying 
          D            | D |
or even how much I owed

        Em            D    		             
Movin' eight miles a minute 
          G
for months at a time   	
         Em          C   
Breakin' all of the rules 
          G
I could bend
Em            D            C		
  I began to find myself searchin'   
   C                 
Searchin' for shelter 
   D
again and again


G              Hm     
  Against the wind     
C                   
  little something 
    	  G
against the wind
   C       Bm            Am       
I found myself seeking shelter 
   C          G
against the wind

             Em      D  		     
Well those drifters days 
           G
are past me now 
         Em       C   
I've got so much more 
           G
to think about
Em      D            C		
  Deadlines and commitments   
  C              
What to leave in, 
  D
what to leave out


G               Hm              
   Against the wind  
C                    
   I'm still runnin' 
             G
against the wind 
      C   Hm           
I'm older now but still 
  Am       C          G   | G |
running against the wind

          C    Hm  	       
Well I'm older now, 
             D     | D |
but still runnin'
