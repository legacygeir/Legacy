I Saw Her Standing There – The Beatles

             E                       
Well she was just seventeen, 
       A           E
if you know what I mean 
        
And the way she looked 
    E7            B7 
was way beyond compare 
   E           E7           A     C        
So how could I dance with another    
       E    E7   B7     E 
when I saw her standing there 
 
     E                     
Well she looked at me, 
    A          E 
and I, I could see 
                         
That before too long 
    E7                B7 
I'd fall in love with her 
E            E7         A      C           
She wouldn't dance with another,    
        E  E7   B7        E 
when I saw her standing there 
 
        A 
Well my heart went boom , 

when I crossed that room 
                       B7   Bb7  A7   STOP 
and I held her hand in mineeeeee 
        E                        
Well we danced through the night 
       A               E 
and we held each other tight 
                      
and before too long 
  E7                B7
I fell in love with her 
    E            E7         A      C         
Now I'll never dance with another,    
      E   E7  B7         E
since I saw her standing there
