  And now my life has changed
     F#m
in oh so many ways,
D 
  my independence seems
    E
to vanish in the haze.

  But every now and then
   F#m
I feel so insecure
D
  I know that I just need you like 
       E
I've never done before

A
Help me if you can,

I'm feeling down
      D
