C                        	        
Gazing through the window 
        Am
at the world outside.  
 C                             Am
Wondering will mother earth survive
F                             
Hoping that mankind will stop 
    Dm             G - G4 - G
abusing her, sometime

C                 		
After all there's 
              Am
only just the two of us.  
     C          
And here we are 
                        Am
still fighting for our lives
F                      
Watching all of history 
   Dm           
repeat itself, 
            G - G4 - G
time after time

             C      
I'm just a dreamer 
   Am            Em G
I dream my life away             
             C     
I'm just a dreamer 
      Am              Em G !
Who dreams of better days

   C                            
I watch the sun go down 
          Am 
like everyone of us.  
     C                  
I'm hoping that the dawn 
              Am
will bring a sign
   F                     
a better place for those 
               Dm      
who will come after us, 
      G - G4 - G
this time

             C      
I'm just a dreamer 
    Am            Em     G
I dream my life away oh yeah      
             C        
I'm just a dreamer 
      Am              Em G
Who dreams of better days

       Dm                       
Your higher power 
               G
may be God or Jesus Christ. 
    Dm                           G 
It doesn't really matter much to me
     Dm                              
Without each other's help 
                G 
there ain't no hope for us.  
     Dm                      G
I'm living in a dream of fantasy,
                 C           
oh yeah, yeah, yeah

Guitar:    
    C    Am    C    Am    

    C    Am    Em   G      C

    C                    
If only we could all 
             Am
just find serenity.  
    C           
It would be nice 
                    Am
if we could live as one
  F                          
When will all this anger, 
           Dm      
hate and biggotry, 
     G - G4 - G
be gone?

             C      
I'm just a dreamer 
    Am           Em      G
I dream my life away, today
             C       
I'm just a dreamer 
      Am              Em      G
Who dreams of better days, o yay
             C       
I'm just a dreamer 
       Am                Em     G
Who's searching for the way, today
             C      
I'm just a dreamer 
 Am               Em   
Dreaming my life away, 
      G          C !
oh yeah, yeah, yeah
