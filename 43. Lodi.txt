A                        
Just about a year ago, 
  D              A
I set out on the road,
 		    F#m       
Seekin my fame and fortune, 
D                   E7
lookin for a pot of gold.
A                       
Things got bad, 
    F#m                 
and things got worse, 
  D                
I guess you will 
          A
know the tune.

          
Oh ! lord, 
 E        D      A
stuck in Lodi again.

A                        
Rode in on the Greyhound, 
        D               A
I ll be walkin out if I go.
                  F#m     
I was just passin through, 
        D               E7
must be seven months or more.
A                   F#m    
Ran out of time and money, 
D               
looks like they 
           A
took my friends.

 Oh ! lord, 
 E        D      A
stuck in Lodi again.

    A                         
The man from the magazine 
D                A
said I was on my way.
                    
Somewhere 
       F#m
I lost connections, 
D                   E7
ran out of songs to play.
   A                           
I came into town, 
  F#m  
a one night stand, 
D                   
looks like my plans 
       A
fell through

 Oh ! lord, 
 E        D      A
stuck in Lodi again. 

     A                           
If I only had a dollar, 
    D                A
for every song I’ve sung.
                   
And every time 
     F#m
I’ve had to play 
      D     
while people 
           E7
sat there drunk.
    A            
You know, 
               F#m
I’d catch the next train 
D                A
back to where I live.

 Oh ! lord, 
 E        D      A
stuck in Lodi again.         
 Oh ! lord, 
 E        D      A
stuck in Lodi again.
