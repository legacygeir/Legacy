  Johnny B. Goode - Chuck Berry

Intro:  A!  D   A    E7   A

      A
Deep down in Louisiana, 

close to New Orleans,
     A
Way back up in the woods 

among the evergreens,
        D
There stood a log cabin 

made of earth and wood
        A
Where lived a country boy 

named Johnny B. Goode
     E
Who never ever learned 

to read or write so well,
               A
But he could play the guitar 

just like a ringin' a bell.

    A
Go! Go! Go, Johnny, go! Go!
		D
Go, Johnny, go! Go!
		 A
Go, Johnny, go! Go!
                E               A
Go, Johnny, go! Go! Johnny B. Goode

            A	
He used to carry his guitar 

in a gunny sack,
    A
Go sit beneath the tree 

by the railroad track.
       D
Old engineers would see him

sittin' in the shade,
   A
Strummin' with the rhythm 

that the drivers made.
       E	
When people passed him by

they would stop and say,
    A
oh, my but that little

country boy could play'

    A
Go! Go! Go, Johnny, go! Go!
		D
Go, Johnny, go! Go!
		 A
Go, Johnny, go! Go!
                E               A
Go, Johnny, go! Go! Johnny B. Goode

Guitarsolo: 

A !  D   A   E7   A

    A
His mother told him,

'someday you will be a man,
A
You will be the leader of a big ol' band.
       D	
Many people comin' 

from miles around 
      A
Will hear you play your music 

when the sun go down.
 E
Maybe someday your name'll be in lights, 
         A
Sayin' 'Johnny B. Goode tonight'

    A
Go! Go! Go, Johnny, go! Go!
		D
Go, Johnny, go! Go!
		 A
Go, Johnny, go! Go!
                E               A
Go, Johnny, go! Go! Johnny B. Goode
