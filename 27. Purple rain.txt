   I never meant to 
	       D#
cause you any pain.

N/C                     
   I never wanted to

be your weekend lover,
 Gm11	F		
          I only wanted 
		    D#
to be some kind of friend.
Bbadd9               
   Baby I could never 
                  Gm11
steal you from another,
F                  
  It's such a shame

our friendship had to end.

 N/C                       
   Honey I know, I know, 
                   Bbadd9
I know times are changing,
  Gm11	F               
        It's time we all 
                         D#
reach out for something new.   

That means you too.  
       
Bbadd9                Gm11 
  You say you want a leader, 

But you can't seem 

to make up your mind.
                      F
 I think you better close it.  

And let me guide you     
		Bbadd9
to the purple rain.


N/C                   D#   
 Purple rain, Purple rain.

 Purple rain, Purple rain.
Gm11                  F 
 Purple rain, Purple rain.   
F							         
   I only want to see you, 
F
   I only want to see you, 
F
   I only want to see you
		       Bbadd9
dancing in the purple rain.
