Intro:  B  

           B
Well I woke up this morning 
                B
stumbled out of my rack. 
   B
I opened up the paper 
           B
to the page in the back. 
    E
It only took a minute 
           E
for my finger to find
       B
My daily dose of destiny, 
B
under my sign. 
       F#
My eyes just about popped 
  F#
out of my head It said 
        B ! 
"the stars 
n.c
are stacked against you 
 n.c
"girl, get back in bed"
               

        E
I feel lucky, 
        B 
I feel lucky, yeah.  
 F#7
No Professor Doom 

gonna stand in my way
B!       n.c.
 Mmmmm, I feel lucky today

          B
Well I strolled down 

to the corner, 
         B
gave my numbers to the clerk. 
     B
The pot's eleven million 
      B			       
so I called in sick to work. 
   E
I bought a pack of Camels, 
   E
a burrito and a Barq's.
B
Crossed against the light, 
        B
made a beeline for the park. 
    F#7
The sky began to thunder, 
F#7                              
wind began to moan. 
           B!     n.c.
I heard a voice above me saying,

"girl, you better get back home"


	    E
But I feel lucky, oh oh oh,
         B   
 I feel lucky, yeah 
     F#7 
No tropical depression 
       F#7
gonna steal my sun away
  B!                   n.c.
 Mmmmm, I feel lucky today

      B !
Now eleven million later, 

I was sitting at the bar. 
     B !  
I'd bought the house a double, 

and the waitress a new car. 
   	E !
Dwight Yoakam's in the corner, 

trying to catch my eye
      B !
Lyle Lovett's right beside me 

with his hand upon my thigh.   
     F#7 !      
The moral of this story, it's 
 F#7 !
simple but it's true, 
          B 
Hey the stars might lie, 
         A7
but the numbers never do


        E
I feel lucky, oh oh oh, 
        B
I feel lucky, yeah 
     F#7
Hey Dwight, hey Lyle, 

boys, you don't have to fight.
B 
 Hot dog, 

I'm feeling lucky tonight


        E 
I feel lucky, brrrrr, 
        B
I feel lucky, yeah 
  F#7
