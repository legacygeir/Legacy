Piano intro. NC!	



			  		 
Just take those 
	     E
old records off the shelf	
                                     
I’ll sit and listen 
	 A
to them by myself
  
todays music 
       B7
ain’t got the same soul	

I like that 
	  E
old time rock and roll


E 
Don’t try to take me 
      
to a disco		

you'll never even 
	A
get me out on the floor
  
in ten minutes I’ll be 
  B7
leavin’ for the door	

I like that old time 
 E 		B7
rock and roll

                                			                        
                    
B7	      
Still like that   
	  E
Old time rock and roll

that kind of music 
       A
just soothes the soul
        			                
I reminisce about 
     B7
the days of old	

with that old time 
 E	      B7
rock and roll

Solo: 

	E A B7 E

B7                                             			                                    
  Won’t go to hear them 
	 E
play a tango	

I’d rather hear some 
	   A
blues and funky old soul
                                               			                     
There’s only one sure 
        B7
way to get me to go	

start playing 
	  E
old time rock and roll

E                                  			                                                
  Call me a relic 
	  E
call me what you will		

say I’m old fashioned 
         A
and I’m over the hill
                               				                
todays music ain’t 
B7
got the same soul
